\f0\fs24 \cf0 I wanted to analyze the bike rides during the start of the pandemic the month of March 2020. I looked at the trend of females and males during this time. Males rode a much high percentage but male and females dramatically decreased once the shutdowns started happening around March 20th. The next thing I wanted to create was two different visuals that represent the top 10 end stations during March 2020 they were all in the center of the city center of New York which makes sense for commuting to work.}
